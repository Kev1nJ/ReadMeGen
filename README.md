## Description
- The purpose of this project is to generator a set template of questions that any user can answer to create a quality README file. The aim for this is to cut done on time for creating README files to be committed to Github repos and make the task of creating a README file simpler and more effecient. (this project is incomplete , the full functionality of the README generator is inefficient)
